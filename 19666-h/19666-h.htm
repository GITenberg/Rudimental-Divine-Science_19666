<p><i><a name="1">How</a> would you define Christian Science?</i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1<br><br>AS the law
of God, the law of good, interpreting and<br>demonstrating the divine Principle and rule
of&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3<br>universal
harmony.<br><br><i><a name="2">What</a> is the Principle of Christian
Science?</i><br><br>It is God, the Supreme Being, infinite and immortal&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 6<br>Mind, the Soul of man and the universe. It is our
Father<br>which is in heaven.&nbsp; It is substance, Spirit, Life, Truth,<br>and Love, --
these are the deific Principle.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; 9<br><br><i><a name="3">Do</a> you mean by this that God is a
person?</i><br><br>The word person affords a large margin for misappre-<br>hension, as
well as definition.&nbsp; In French the equivalent&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 12<br>word
is <i>personne</i>.&nbsp; In Spanish, Italian, and Latin, it
is<br><i>persona</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Latin verb <i>personare</i> is compounded of<br>the
prefix <i>per</i> (through) and <i>sonare</i> (to sound).&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;15<br><br>In law, Blackstone applies the word
<i>personal</i> to <i>bodily<br>presence</i>, in distinction from one's appearance (in
court,<br>for example) by deputy or proxy.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 18<br><br>Other
definitions of <i>person</i>, as give by Webster, are&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; 1<br>"a living soul; a self-conscious being; a moral agent;<br>especially, a
living human being, a corporeal man, woman,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 3<br>or child; an
individual of the human race." He adds,<br>that among Trinitarian Christians the word
stands for one<br>of the three subjects, or agents, constituting the Godhead.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; 6<br><br>In Christian Science we learn that God is definitely indi-
<br>vidual and not a <i>person</i>, as that word is used by the best<br>authorities, if
our lexicographers are right in defining&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9<br><i>person</i> as
especially a finite <i>human being</i>; but God is<br>personal, if by <i>person</i> is
meant infinite Spirit.<br><br>We do not conceive rightly of God, if we think of Him&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 12<br>as less than infinite.&nbsp; The human person is
finite; and<br>therefore I prefer to retain the proper sense of Diety by<br>using the
phrase <i>an individual</i> God rather than <i>a per-</i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 15<br><i>sonal</i> God; for there is and can be but on infinite indi-
<br>vidual spirit, who mortals have named God.<br><br>Science defines the individuality
of God as supreme&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 18<br>good, Life, Truth,
Love.&nbsp; This term enlarges our sense<br>of Diety, takes away the trammels assigned to
God by<br>finite though, and introduces us to higher definitions.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; 21<br><br><i><a name="4">Is</a> healing the sick the whole of
Science?</i><br><br>Healing physical sickness is the smallest part of Chris-<br>tian
Science.&nbsp; It is only the bugle-call to thought and&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
24<br>action, in the higher range of infinite goodness.&nbsp; The<br>emphatic purpose of
Christian Science is the healing of<br>sin; and this task, sometimes, may be harder than
the&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 27<br>cure of disease; because, while mortals
love to sin, they&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br>do not love to be sick.&nbsp; Hence
their comparative acqui-<br>escence in your endeavors to heal them of bodily ills,
and&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3<br>their obstinate resistance to all efforts to save them
from<br>sin through Christ, spiritual Truth and Love, which<br>redeem them, and become
their Saviour, through the&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6<br>flesh,
from the flesh, -- the material world and evil.<br><br>This Life, Truth, and Love -- this
trinity of good -- was<br>individualized, to the perception of mortal sense, in the&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 9<br>man Jesus.&nbsp; His history is emphatic in our hearts, and
it<br>lives more because of his spiritual than his physical healing.<br>His example is,
to Christian Scientists, what the models&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 12<br>of the masters
in music and painting are to artists.<br><br>Genuine Christian Scientists will no more
deviate mor-<br>ally from that divine digest of Science called the Sermon&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; 15<br>on the Mount, than they will manipulate invalids, prescribe<br>drugs,
or deny God.&nbsp; Jesus' healing was spiritual in its<br>nature, method, and
design.&nbsp; He wrought the cure of&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
18<br>disease through the divine Mind, which gives all true<br>volition, impulse, and
action; and destroys the mental<br>error made manifest physically, and establishes the
oppo-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 21<br>site manifestation of Truth upon the body in
harmony<br>and health.<br><br><i><a name="5">By</a> the individuality of God, do you mean
that God has</i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;24<br><i>a finite
form?</i><br><br>No.&nbsp; I mean the infinite and divine Principle of all<br>being, the
ever-present I AM, filling all space, including&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 27<br>in itself all
Mind, the one Father-Mother God.&nbsp; Life,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
1<br>Truth, and Love are this trinity in unity, and their uni-<br>verse is spiritual,
peopled with perfect beings, harmonious&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 3<br>and eternal, of which our
material universe and men are<br>the counterfeits.<br><br><i><a name="6">Is</a> God the
Principle of all science, or only of Divine or</i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;6<br><i>Christian Science?</i><br><br>Science is Mind manifested.&nbsp; It is not
material; neither<br>is it of human origin.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9<br><br>All true Science represents a moral and spiritual
force,<br>which holds the earth in its orbit.&nbsp; This force is Spirit,<br>that can
"bind the sweet influences of the Pleiades," and&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 12<br>"loose
the bands of Orion."<br><br>There is no material science, if by that term you
mean<br>material intelligence.&nbsp; God is infinite Mind, hence there&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; 15<br>is no other Mind.&nbsp; Good is Mind, but evil is not Mind.<br>Good is
not in evil, but in God only. Spirit is not in matter,<br>but in Spirit only. Law is not
in matter, but in Mind only.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 18<br><br><i><a name="7">Is</a> there no
matter?</i><br><br>All is Mind.&nbsp; According to the Scriptures and
Christian<br>Science, all is God, and there is naught beside Him.&nbsp; "God&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; 21<br>is Spirit;" and we can only learn and love Him through<br>His spirit, which
brings out the fruits of Spirit and ex-<br>tinguishes forever the works of darkness by
His marvel-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 24<br>lous light.<br><br>The five material
senses testify to the existence of<br>matter.&nbsp; The spiritual senses afford no such
evidence,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1<br>but deny the testimony of the material
senses.&nbsp; Which<br>testimony is correct?&nbsp; The Bible says: "Let God be&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3<br>true, and every man a liar."&nbsp; If, as
the Scriptures imply,<br>God is All-in-all, then all must be Mind, since God
is<br>Mind.&nbsp; Therefore in divine Science there is no material&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; 6<br>mortal man, for man is spiritual and eternal, he being<br>made in the
image of Spirit, or God.<br><br>There is no material sense.&nbsp; Matter is inert,
inanimate,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9<br>and sensationless, -- considered apart from
Mind.&nbsp; Lives<br>there a man who has ever found Soul in the body or in<br>matter, who
has ever seen spiritual substance with the&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 12<br>eye,
who has found sight in matter, hearing in the material<br>ear, or intelligence in non-
intelligence?&nbsp; If there is any<br>such thing as matter, it must be either mind which
is&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 15<br>called matter, or matter without
Mind.<br><br>Matter without Mind is a moral impossibility.&nbsp; Mind<br>in matter is
pantheism.&nbsp; Soul is the only real conscious-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 18<br>ness
which cognizes being.&nbsp; The body does not see, hear,<br>smell, or taste.&nbsp; Human
belief says that it does; but<br>destroy this belief of seeing with the eye, and we
could&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 21<br>not see materially; and so it is with each of the
physical<br>senses.<br><br>Accepting the verdict of these material senses, we
should&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 24<br>believe man and the universe to be the football of
chance<br>and sinking into oblivion.&nbsp;&nbsp; Destroy the five senses as<br>organized
matter, and you must either become non-exist-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 27<br>ent,
or exist in Mind only; and this latter conclusion is<br>the simple solution of the
problem of being, and leads to&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br>the equal inference that
there is no matter.<br><br><i><a name="8">The</a> sweet sounds and glories of earth and
sky, assum-</i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3<br><i>ing manifold forms and
colors, -- are they not tangible and</i><br><i>material?</i><br><br>As Mind they are
real, but not as matter.&nbsp; All beauty&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
6<br>and goodness are in and of Mind, emanating from God;<br>but when we change the
nature of beauty and goodness<br>from Mind to matter, the beauty is marred, through
a&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9<br>false conception, and, to the material
senses, evil takes<br>the place of good.<br><br>Has not the truth in Christian Science
met a response&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 12<br>from Prof. S. P. Langley,
the young American astronomer?<br>He says that "color is in <i>us</i>," not "in the
rose;" and he<br>adds that this is not "any metaphysical subtlety," but a&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; 15<br>fact "almost universally accepted, within the <i>last
few</i><br><i>years</i>, by physicists."<br><br><i><a name="9">Is</a> not the basis of
Mind-healing a destruction of the evi-</i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 18<br><i>dence of the
material senses, and restoration of the true</i><br><i>evidence of spiritual
sense?</i><br><br>It is, so far as you perceive and understand this predi-&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; 21<br>cate and postulate of Mind-healing; but the Science of<br>Mind-
healing is best understood in practical demonstra-<br>tion.&nbsp; The proof of what you
apprehend, in the simplest&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;24<br>definite and absolute
form of healing, can alone answer<br>this question of how much you understand of
Christian<br>Science Mind-healing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not that all healing is Science,&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1<br>by any means; but that the simplest case, healed in
Science,<br>is as demonstrably scientific, in a small degree, as the most&nbsp;&nbsp;
3<br>difficult case so treated.<br><br>The infinite and subtler conceptions and
consistencies<br>of Christian Science are set forth in my work Science and&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; 6<br>Health.<br><br><i><a name="10">Is</a> man material or
spiritual?</i><br><br>In Science, man is the manifest reflection of God, per-&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 9<br>feet and immortal Mind.&nbsp; He is the likeness of God;
and<br>His likeness would be lost if inverted or perverted.<br><br>According to the
evidence of the so-called physical&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
12<br>senses, man is material, fallen, sick, depraved, mortal.<br>Science and spiritual
sense contradict this, and they afford<br>the only true evidence of the being of God and
man, the&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 15<br>material evidence being wholly
false.<br><br>Jesus said of personal evil, that "the truth abode not<br>in him," because
there is no material sense.&nbsp; Matter, as&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 18<br>matter, has
neither sensation nor personal intelligence.<br>As a pretension to be Mind, matter is a
lie, and "the<br>father of lies;" Mind is not in matter, and Spirit cannot&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; 21<br>originate its opposite, named matter.<br><br>According to divine
Science, Spirit no more changes its<br>species, by evolving matter from Spirit, than
natural&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 24<br>science, so-called, or material
laws, bring about altera-<br>tion of species by transforming minerals into
vegetables<br>or plants into animals, -- thus confusing and confounding&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; 27<br>the three great kingdoms.&nbsp; No rock brings forth an apple;&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br>no pine-tree produces a mammal or provides breast-milk<br>for
babes.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3<br><br>To sense, the lion of to-day is the lion of six
thousand<br>years ago; but in Science, Spirit sends forth its own harm-<br>less
likeness.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; 6<br><br><i><a name="11">How</a> should I undertake to demonstrate
Christian Science</i><br><i>in healing the sick?</i><br><br>As I have given you only an
epitome of the Principle,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 9<br>so I can give you
here nothing but an outline of the prac-<br>tice. Be honest, be true to thyself, and true
to others;<br>then it follows thou wilt be strong in God, the eternal&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; 12<br>good. Heal through Truth and Love; there is no
other<br>healer.<br><br>In all moral revolutions, from a lower to a higher con-&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 15<br>dition of thought and action, Truth is in the minority
and<br>error has the majority.&nbsp; It is not otherwise in the field<br>of Mind-
healing.&nbsp; The man who calls himself a Christian&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
18<br>Scientist, yet is false to God and man, is also uttering<br>falsehood about
good.&nbsp; This falsity shuts against him the<br>Truth and the Principle of Science, but
opens a way&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 21<br>whereby, through will-
power, sense may say the unchris-<br>tian practitioner can heal; but Science shows that
he makes<br>morally worse the invalid whom he is supposed to cure.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; 24<br><br>By this I mean that mortal mind should not be
falsely<br>impregnated.&nbsp; If by such lower means the health is seem-<br>ingly
restored, the restoration is not lasting, and the patient 27<br>is liable to a relapse, -
- "The last state of that man is&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br>worse than the
first."<br><br>The teacher of Mind-healing who is not a Christian,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 3<br>in the highest sense, is constantly sowing the seeds
of<br>discord and disease.&nbsp; Even the truth he speaks is more<br>or less blended with
error; and this error will spring up&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 6<br>in the mind of his
pupil.&nbsp; The pupil's imperfect knowl-<br>edge will lead to weakness in practice, and
he will be a<br>poor practitioner, if not a malpractitioner.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9<br><br>The basis of malpractice is in erring
human will, and<br>this will is an outcome of what I call <i>mortal mind</i>, --
a<br>false and temporal sense of Truth, Life, and Love.&nbsp; To&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; 12<br>heal, in Christian Science, is to base your practice on<br>immortal
Mind, the divine Principle of man's being; and<br>this requires a preparation of the
heart and an answer&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 15<br>of the lips from the
Lord.<br><br>The Science of healing is the Truth of healing.&nbsp; If<br>one is
untruthful, his mental state weighs against his&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
18<br>healing power; and similar effects come from pride,<br>envy, lust, and all fleshly
vices.<br><br>The spiritual power of a scientific, right thought, with-&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; 21<br>out a direct effort, an audible or even a mental argument,<br>has
oftentimes healed inveterate diseases.<br><br>The thoughts of the practitioner should be
imbued with&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 24<br>a clear conviction of the omnipotence
and omnipresence<br>of God; that He is All, and that there can be none beside<br>Him;
that God is good, and the producer only of good;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
27<br>and hence, that whatever militates against health, har-<br>mony, or holiness, is an
unjust usurper of the throne of&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1<br>the controller of all
mankind.&nbsp; Note this, that if you have<br>power in error, you forfeit the power that
Truth bestows,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 3<br>and its salutary influence on yourself and
others.<br><br>You must feel and know that God alone governs man;<br>that His government
is harmonious; that He is too pure&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6<br>to behold
iniquity, and divides His power with nothing<br>evil or material; that material laws are
only human be-<br>liefs, which govern mortals wrongfully. These beliefs arise&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; 9<br>from the subjective states of thought, producing the be-<br>liefs of a
mortal material universe, -- so-called, and of<br>material disease and mortality.&nbsp;
Mortal ills are but errors&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 12<br>of thought, -- diseases of mortal
mind, and not of matter;<br>for matter cannot feel, see, or report pain or
disease,<br><br>Disease is a thing of thought manifested on the body;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 15<br>and fear is the procurator of the thought which
causes<br>sickness and suffering. Remove this fear by the true<br>sense that God is Love,
-- and that Love punishes nothing&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 18<br>but sin, -- and the
patient can then look up to the loving<br>God, and know that He afflicteth not willingly
the children<br>of men, who are punished because of disobedience to His&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 21<br>spiritual law.&nbsp; His law of Truth, when obeyed,
removes<br>every erroneous physical and mental state.&nbsp; The belief<br>that matter can
master Mind, and make you ill, is an&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 24<br>error
which Truth will destroy.<br><br>You must learn to acknowledge God in all His ways.<br>It
is only a lack of understanding of the allness of God,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
27<br>which leads you to believe in the existence of matter, or<br>that matter can frame
its own conditions, contrary to the&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br>law of
Spirit.<br><br>Sickness is the schoolmaster, leading you to Christ;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3<br>first to faith in Christ; next to belief in God as omnipo-
<br>tent; and finally to the <i>understanding</i> of God and man<br>in Christian Science,
whereby you learn that God is good,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 6<br>and in Science man is
His likeness, the forever reflection of<br>goodness.&nbsp; Therefore good is one and
All.<br><br>This brings forward the next proposition in Christian&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 9<br>Science, -- namely, that there are no sickness, sin,
and<br>death in the divine Mind.&nbsp; What seem to be disease, vice,<br>and mortality
are illusions of the physical senses.&nbsp; These&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 12<br>illusions are
not real, but unreal.&nbsp; Health is the conscious-<br>ness of the unreality of pain and
disease; or, rather, the<br>absolute consciousness of harmony and of nothing else.&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 15<br>In a moment you may awake from a night-dream;
just<br>so you can awake from the dream of sickness; but the<br>demonstration of the
Science of Mind-healing by no means&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 18<br>rests on the
strength of human belief.&nbsp; This demonstra-<br>tion is based on a true understanding
of God and divine<br>Science, which takes away every human belief, and,&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 21<br>through the illumination of spiritual
understanding, re-<br>veals the all-power and ever-presence of good, whence<br>emanate
health, harmony, and Life eternal.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

Christian<br>Scientist, never introduces the subject of human anatomy;<br>never depicts
the muscular, vascular, or nervous opera-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 27<br>tions of
the human frame.&nbsp;&nbsp; He never talks about the<br>structure of the material body.
He never lays his hands&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br>on the patient, nor
manipulates the parts of the body sup-<br>posed to be ailing. Above all, he keeps
unbroken the Ten&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3<br>Commandments, and practises Christ's
Sermon on the<br>Mount.<br><br>Wrong thoughts and methods strengthen the sense of&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6<br>disease, instead of cure it; or else quiet
the fear of the <br>sick on false grounds, encouraging them in the belief of<br>error
until they hold stronger than before the belief that&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9<br>they are
first made sick by matter, and then restored<br>through its agency. This fosters
infidelity, and is mental<br>quackery, that denies the Principle of Mind-healing.&nbsp;
If&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 12<br>the sick are aided in this mistaken fashion, their
ailments<br>will return, and be more stubborn because the relief is<br>unchristian and
unscientific.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 15<br><br>Christian Science erases from
the minds of invalids<br>their mistaken belief that they live in or because of
matter,<br>or that a so-called material organism controls the health&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; 18<br>or existence of mankind, and induces rest in God, divine<br>Love, as
caring for all the conditions requisite for the well-<br>being of man.&nbsp; As power
divine is the healer, why should&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 21<br>mortals concern
themselves with the chemistry of food?<br>Jesus said: "Take no thought what ye shall
eat."<br><br>The practitioner should also endeavor to free the minds&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; 24<br>of the healthy from any sense of subordination to their<br>bodies, and
teach them that the divine Mind, not material<br>law, maintains human health and
life.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; 27<br><br>A Christian Scientist knows that, in Science, disease<br>is
unreal; that Mind is not in matter; that Life is God,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
1<br>good; hence Life is not functional, and is neither matter<br>nor mortal mind; knows
that pantheism and theosophy&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 3<br>are not
Science.&nbsp; Whatever saps, with human belief,<br>this basis of Christian Science,
renders it impossible to<br>demonstrate the Principle of this Science, even in the&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6<br>smallest degree.<br><br>A mortal and material body is
not the actual individuality<br>of man made in the divine and spiritual image of
God.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 9<br>The material body is not the likeness
of Spirit; hence it<br>is not the truth of being, but the likeness of error ?
the<br>human belief which saith there is more than one God, --&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; 12<br>there is more than one Life and one Mind.<br><br>In Deuteronomy (iv.
35) we read:&nbsp; "The Lord, He is<br>God; there is none else beside Him."&nbsp; In John
(iv. 24)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 15<br>we may read: "God is Spirit."&nbsp;
These propositions, un-<br>derstood in their Science, elucidate my meaning.<br><br>When
treating a patient, it is not Science to treat every&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
18<br>organ in the body.&nbsp; To aver that harmony is the real and<br>discord is the
unreal, and then give special attention to<br>what according to their own belief is
diseased, is scientific;&nbsp; 21<br>and if the <i>healer realizes</i> the truth, it will
free his patient.<br><br><i><a name="12">What</a> are the means and, methods of
trustworthy Christian</i><br><i>Scientists?</i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;24<br><br>These people
should not be expected, more than others,<br>to give all their time to Christian Science
work, receiving<br>no wages in return, but left to be fed, clothed, and sheltered&nbsp;
27<br>by charity.&nbsp; Neither can they serve two masters, giving&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br>only a portion of their time to God, and still be
Christian<br>Scientists.&nbsp; They must give Him all their services, and&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 3<br>"owe no man."&nbsp; To do this, they must at present ask
a<br>suitable price for their services, and then <i>conscientiously</i><br><i>earn their
wages</i>, strictly practising Divine Science, and&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;6<br>healing
the sick.<br><br>The author never sought charitable support, but gave<br>fully seven-
eighths of her time without remuneration, ex-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;9<br>cept the
bliss of doing good. The only pay taken for her<br>labors was from classes, and often
those were put off for<br>months, in order to do gratuitous work.&nbsp; She has
never&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 12<br>taught a Primary class without several, and
sometimes<br>seventeen, free students in it; and has endeavored to take<br>the full price
of tuition only from those who were able to&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 15<br>pay.&nbsp; The
student who pays must of necessity do better<br>than he who does not pay, and yet will
expect and require<br>others to pay him.&nbsp; No discount on tuition was made on&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 18<br>higher classes, because their first classes furnished
students<br>with the means of paying for their tuition in the higher<br>instruction, and
of doing charity work besides.&nbsp; If the&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
21<br>Primary students are still impecunious, it is their own<br>fault, and this ill-
success of itself leaves them unprepared<br>to enter higher classes.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 24<br><br>People are being healed by means of my
instructions,<br>both in and out of class.&nbsp; Many students, who have<br>passed
through a regular course of instruction from me,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
27<br>have been invalids and were healed in the class; but ex-<br>perience has shown that
this defrauds the scholar, though&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br>it heals the
sick.<br><br>It is seldom that a student, if healed hi a class, has left&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3<br>it understanding sufficiently the Science of healing to im-
<br>mediately enter upon its practice.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because the<br>glad surprise of
suddenly regained health is a shock to&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 6<br>the mind;
and this holds and satisfies the thought with<br>exuberant joy.<br><br>This renders the
mind less inquisitive, plastic, and tract-&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 9<br>able; and deep
systematic thinking is impracticable until<br>this impulse subsides.<br><br>This was the
principal reason for advising diseased&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
12<br>people not to enter a class.&nbsp; Few were taken besides inva-<br>lids for
students, until there were enough practitioners to<br>fill in the best possible manner
the department of healing.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 15<br>Teaching and healing should have
separate departments,<br>and these should be fortified on all sides with suitable
and<br>thorough guardianship and grace.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 18<br><br>Only a very
limited number of students can advanta-<br>geously enter a class, grapple with this
subject, and well<br>assimilate what has been taught them.&nbsp; It is impossible&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 21<br>to teach thorough Christian Science to promiscuous
and<br>large assemblies, or to persons who cannot be addressed<br>individually, so that
the mind of the pupil may be dissected&nbsp; &nbsp; 24<br>more critically than the body
of a subject laid bare for<br>anatomical examination.&nbsp; Public lectures cannot be
such<br>lessons in Christian Science as are required to empty and&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; 27<br>to fill anew the individual mind.<br><br>If publicity and material
control are the motives for&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br>teaching, then
public lectures can take the place of private<br>lessons; but the former can never give a
thorough knowledge&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 3<br>of Christian Science, and a Christian
Scientist will never<br>undertake to fit students for practice by such means. Lec-
<br>tures in public are needed, but they must be subordinate&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
6<br>to thorough class instruction in any branch of education.<br><br>None with an
imperfect sense of the spiritual significa-<br>tion of the Bible, and its scientific
relation to Mind-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 9<br>healing, should attempt overmuch
in their translation of<br>the Scriptures into the "new tongue;" but I see that<br>some
novices, in the truth of Science, and some impostors are&nbsp;&nbsp; 12 <br>committing
this error.<br><br><i><a name="13">Is</a> there more than one school of scientific
healing?</i><br><br>In reality there is, and can be, but one school of the&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 15<br>Science of Mind-healing.&nbsp; Any departure from Science
is<br>an irreparable loss of Science.&nbsp; Whatever is said and<br>written correctly on
this Science originates from the Princi-&nbsp;&nbsp; 18<br>ple and practice laid down in
Science and Health, a work<br>which I published in 1875.&nbsp; This was the first book,
re-<br>corded in history, which elucidates a pathological Science&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
21<br>purely mental.<br><br>Minor shades of difference in Mind-healing have origi-
<br>nated with certain opposing factions, springing up among&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
24<br>unchristian students, who, fusing with a class of aspirants<br>which snatch at
whatever is progressive, call it their first-<br>fruits, or else <i>post mortem</i>
evidence. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; 27<br><br>A slight divergence is fatal in Science.&nbsp; Like certain&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1<br>Jews whom St. Paul had hoped to convert from
mere<br>motives of self-aggrandizement to the love of Christ, these&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
3<br>so-called schools are clogging the wheels of progress by<br>blinding the people to
the true character of Christian<br>Science, -- its moral power, and its divine efficacy
to&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 6<br>heal.<br><br>The true understanding of Christian
Science Mind-<br>healing never originated in pride, rivalry, or the deification&nbsp;
9<br>of self.&nbsp; The Discoverer of this Science could tell you of<br>timidity, of
self-distrust, of friendlessness, toil, agonies, and<br>victories under which she needed
miraculous vision to&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 12<br>sustain her, when
taking the first footsteps in this<br>Science.<br><br>The ways of Christianity have not
changed.&nbsp; Meek-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 15<br>ness,
selflessness, and love are the paths of His testimony<br>and the footsteps of His
flock.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
